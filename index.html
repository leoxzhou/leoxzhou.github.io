	I am an Assistant Professor of <a data-url="https://samueli.ucla.edu/people/leo-zhou/" href="https://samueli.ucla.edu/people/leo-zhou/">Electrical and Computer Engineering</a> at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA).
	My research group welcomes highly self-driven students with a passion for quantum science. <b>We also have an opening for a postdoctoral scholar to start in 2026 -- stay tuned for details!</b>
	<!-- <em>We also offer <strong>postdoctoral fellowships</strong> for exceptional candidates with expertise in quantum computation, algorithms and complexity, high-dimensional probability/statistics, spin glass theory, and quantum optics.</em> -->
</p>
<p>
	Prior to UCLA, I was a <a data-url="https://burkeinstitute.caltech.edu/people/postdoctoral-fellows" href="https://burkeinstitute.caltech.edu/people/postdoctoral-fellows" target="_blank" title="">DuBridge Postdoctoral Scholar</a> at the Walter Burke Institute for Theoretical Physics at Caltech, hosted by <a data-url="http://theory.caltech.edu/~preskill/" href="http://theory.caltech.edu/~preskill/" target="_blank" title="">John Preskill</a>. I received my PhD in Physics from Harvard University under the guidance of <a data-url="https://lukin.physics.harvard.edu/" href="https://lukin.physics.harvard.edu/" target="_blank" title="">Mikhail Lukin</a>, after obtaining my BSc in Physics and Mathematics at MIT where I also worked with <a data-url="https://physics.mit.edu/faculty/edward-farhi/" href="https://physics.mit.edu/faculty/edward-farhi/" target="_blank" title="">Edward Farhi</a>.
</p>

<p>
	My research interests are at the interface of physics, math, and computer science, touching on many topics in quantum information theory, mathematical optimization, computational complexity, and many-body physics. My contributions include analyzing quantum algorithms and architectures, as well as proving fundamental results in quantum complexity theory. I also work closely with experimentalists to develop practical schemes of quantum applications for current and near-term experimental implementations.
